This algorithm requires noise sample, so we can use [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad)
to extract samples from input audios.

# Generating dataset
### UrbanSound8K
This dataset contains 8732 labeled sound excerpts (<=4s) of urban sounds from 10 classes: air_conditioner, car_horn, 
children_playing, dog_bark, drilling, enginge_idling, gun_shot, jackhammer, siren, and street_music. The classes are 
drawn from the urban sound taxonomy.

### Mozilla Common Voice
Common Voice is a crowdsourcing project started by Mozilla to create a free database for speech recognition software. 
The project is supported by volunteers who record sample sentences with a microphone and review recordings of other users. The transcribed sentences will be collected in a voice database available under the public domain license CC0. This license ensures that developers can use the database for voice-to-text applications without restrictions or costs.

### Generator
The noisy dataset is generated by adding random noise samples to clean audio.
You can find generator with some samples [here](https://github.com/noise-reduction/dataset-generator).

# Performance
We can use the following metrics to evaluate this models.
### Speech Quality Measures
+ Segmental Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNRseg)
+ Frequency-weighted Segmental SNR (fwSNRseg)
+ Log-likelihood Ratio (LLR)
+ Weighted Spectral Slope (WSS)
+ Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ)
+ Composite Objective Speech Quality (composite)
+ Cepstrum Distance Objective Speech Quality Measure (CD)

### Speech Intelligibility Measures
+ Short-time objective intelligibility (STOI)
+ Coherence and speech intelligibility index (CSII)
+ Normalized-covariance measure (NCM)

[pysepm](https://github.com/schmiph2/pysepm) package contains the implementation for all this metrics.
